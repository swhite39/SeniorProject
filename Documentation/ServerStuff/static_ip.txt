Setting Static IP Address On Raspberry Pi

Viewing your IP address:
	- $: sudo ifconfig
	- Wireless network information will be under wlan

Viewing the IP Address of your Gateway:
	- This is the IP address of your router
	-$: sudo route -nee

To create a static IP address edit the dhcpcd.conf file
	-$: sudo vim /etc/dhcpcd.conf
	- Scroll to the bottom of the file and add these lines:

		interface wlan0

		static ip_address=10.0.0.200/24
	
		static routers=10.0.0.1

		static domain_name_servers=10.0.0.1

	- The above addresses will change depending on the IP address of your router and the IP that you want.
	- Reboot the Pi and test the changes:
		-$: sudo reboot
		-$: sudo ifconfig
To make sure everything is working properly, ping your Gateway address 5 times to ensure you are communicating with your router.
	-$: ping 10.0.0.1 -c 5
